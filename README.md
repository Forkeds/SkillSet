SkillSet
==========

Intuitive job-candidate skill visualization, taking advantage of D3.js and JSONResume.

TODO:
------
>- ~~Flesh out D3 force layout graph structure~~
>- ~~Mock-up skill graph from current skill set~~
>- Set graph from JSONResume data dynamically AND/OR user input
>- Flesh out projects-based viz, either appending to current force layout, or creating an entirely new one
>- Tweak visual cues (~~link opacity for weaker skills~~, mouseover events to show more details)
>- Allow link and picture additions to nodes

Intuitive job-candidate skill visualization, taking advantage of [D3.js](http://d3js.org/) and [JSONResume](https://jsonresume.org/).

Live site:
>- https://jac21.github.io/SkillSet/

Live demo: 
>- https://jac21.github.io/viz.html

TODO:
------
>- ~~Flesh out D3 force layout graph structure~~
>- ~~Mock-up skill graph from current skill set~~
>- ~~Set graph from JSONResume data dynamically AND/OR user input~~
>- Flesh out projects-based viz, either appending to current force layout, or creating an entirely new one
>- Tweak visual cues (~~link opacity for weaker skills~~, mouseover events to show more details)
>- Allow link and picture additions to nodes

To use on your site [(like so)](https://jac21.github.io/viz.html):
----------------------------
>- Git clone using this repository's clone URL: https://github.com/Jac21/SkillSet.git 
>- The "dist" folder contains all you need to run and visualize: "index.html" where the render is displayed, "app.js" where the viz code is written, and "style.css" containing the necessary CSS for the visualization.
>- Simply replace the "mySkills.csv" file with your own personally generated one from the live site: https://jac21.github.io/SkillSet/ 
>- Done and done!
